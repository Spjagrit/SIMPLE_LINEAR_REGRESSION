# SIMPLE_LINEAR_REGRESSION
 In this I have used scikit-learn library to implement Simple linear regression. I downloaded a dataset that is related to fuel consumption and Carbon dioxide emission of cars. Then, I splited the data into training and test sets, create a model using training set, evaluate model using test set, and finally use model to predict unknown value.
